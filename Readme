This is the capstone project course that provides a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with real datasets. The student assumes the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders.   

The student tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.  SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

Therefore if the student can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, the student can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of the student's Data Science findings and models, the competing startup the student has been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This course is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate as well as the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization.
